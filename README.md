# Song-Data-Tech-Intern-Challenge

This repository has been created as part of a Tech Intern Challenge for Summer 2022.

The task is to print the content of the songData.json file on a web page in a tabular manner.

To run this program, after cloning the repository, a few steps need to be followed.

1. After navigate to the src directory, then run the json_converter.py object. This code would remove the invalid dates values. I have considered all years below 1980 as invalid dates.

cd Song-Data-Tech-Intern-Challenge/react-song/src
python3 json_converter.py

2. The file containing the valid JSON dates is songData-valid.json. We now run the React code from the src.

npm start

After running, on the localhost we can see all the valid records, which can be searched on the basis of Song or Artist name, and sorted on the basis of the column needed.

Kindly let me know if any other information is needed.

Thank You
